# Following per window-type options are available: ::
# 
#   fade, shadow:::
#     Controls window-type-specific shadow and fade settings.
# 
#   opacity:::
#     Controls default opacity of the window type.
# 
#   focus:::
#     Controls whether this type is to be always considered focused. 
# 
#   full-shadow:::
#     Controls whether shadow is drawn under the parts of the window
# 	  that you normally won't be able to see.
# 
#   redir-ignore:::
#     Controls whether this type of windows should cause screen
#     to become redirected again after been unredirected.
#     If you have unredir-if-possible set, and doesn't want certain
#     window to cause unnecessary screen redirection,
